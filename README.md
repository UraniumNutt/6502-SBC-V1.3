This is a 6502 SBC I made. It is inspired by the YouTube series by Ben Eater. I made similar version before this, but I thought I could do better before sharing the design. 
My goal was to make a compact, simple computer with a serial port, and a uart usb bridge built in.
I also exposed the system bus, so it should be possible to create expansion cards which are mapped into memory.
